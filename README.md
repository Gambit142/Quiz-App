## Extension of Task
If I were to add a type column in the `Question Model`, I would use polymorphism to create the feature. I would implement the feature by doing the following:

- Create two columns on the *_Question model_*. 
- One column would be the name of another Question Type model (For example `MultipleChoiceQuestion Model`)
- The second would be the specific foreign key to that particular *__Question Type Model__*.
- This would enable me to create a distinct type of Question and I would handle the __*CRUD*__ actions on the model the Question Model references.
